# NF_MethylSeq Workflow Information and Usage Instructions

## General workflow info
The current GeneLab Methyl-Seq sequencing data processing pipeline (MethylSeq), [GL-DPPD-7113.md](../../Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7113_Versions/GL-DPPD-7113.md), is implemented as a [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) DSL2 workflow and can utilize images managed through either [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) or [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/user-guide/introduction.html), or [conda])https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for environments (GeneLab uses Singularity when processing GLDS datasets). This workflow (NF_MethylSeq) is run using the command line interface (CLI) of any unix-based system. While knowledge of creating workflows in Nextflow is not required to run the workflow as is, [the Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) is a useful resource for users who want to modify and/or extend this workflow.
